# Deep-learning-for-cultural-ecosystem-services-of-terraces

This project uses Convolutional Neural Network, the EfficientNet-B3 model, and ImageNet pre-trained weights to classify seven categories of social media images about terraced fields: landscape, species, structures, indoors, food, activities, and posing. 

All of the code was run using Google Colab.

When using it, pay attention to replacing the corresponding folder path and the best model path.
